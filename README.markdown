Simple TODO manager/plugin/whatever for Vim, inspired by [Workflowy.com](https://workflowy.com/)

## Why?

It started with a [tweet](https://twitter.com/#!/lukaszkorecki/status/175637968348917760)

Here's what was "attached":

    # vi: fen foldmethod=indent :
    * lol
      * lol
        * wat
        * wut
    +---  2 lines: * wee ------------------------------------------------------
        * meh
      * ouch

Then I started hacking on a little plugin-ish thing and came up with `workflowish`

# How?

By defining a simple syntax in Vim and using brilliant [folding capabilities](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Folding) *workflowish* can simulate 99% of *Workflowy's* features.


### Features?

- searching (duh, it's, like, in Vim, broseph)
- deleting (as above)
- folding and a `zoom/focus` mode
  - `zq` to focus on current item / toggle off
  - `zp` move focus to parent item
- notes (just add `\` in the beginning of the line to start a comment)
- [vimgrep](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/quickfix.html#:vimgrep) for filtering lines
- todos:
  - a todo which is not completed is a line which starts with `*`
  - completed todo starts with a `-`
- convert from workflowy plain text export
  - in a `.wofl` file or after `:set ft=workflowish`, run `:call workflowish#convert_from_workflowy()` to convert the whole buffer
- split windows in vim makes it easy to organize big lists

Thanks to the long running tradition, *workflowish* files have `.wofl` extension.
